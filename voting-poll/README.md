# Metagraph - Data API - Voting Poll

The following metagraph was inspired from the Constellation Network [voting poll metagraph example](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/metagraph-examples/tree/main/examples/voting-poll) to be used with the [Metagraphs.ai](https://metagraphs-ai.webflow.io/landingpage) hackathon project for DAO governance tooling. 

**Please follow the steps below for local deployment:**
- Follow the [QuickStart](https://docs.constellationnetwork.io/sdk/guides/quick-start) guide for installing the Euclid SDK   

- Copy the 'voting-poll' project into the 'source/project' folder of the Euclid Development Environment 

- Edit the "project_name" field in the "euclid.json" file to have the value "voting-poll"

- Ensure that the "tesselation_version" in the euclid.json is set equal to the same version number as the "source/project/voting-poll/project/Dependencies.scala"  tessellation version.

- Run the `install`, `build`, then `start-genesis` commands

- Please follow the steps below to launch the Sample UI


## Sample UI Project

This example comes with a sample UI web app demonstrating integration with Stargazer Wallet and interaction with the metagraph APIs. You can set it up and run it from the instructions in the [sample-ui](./sample-ui/README.md) folder.
